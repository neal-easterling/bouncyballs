# Bouncy Balls

## Description

An exercise for MIT Mern Fullstack Development class based on edge detection.  Added multiple balls, emitter trajectory, random velocity, and a random color generator based on a single seed  for each ball using data tags.<br>
[Hosted Demo](http://127.0.0.1:5500/neal-easterling.github.io/hosting/bouncyballs/bouncyballs.html)

## Road Map

- style container to look like a bottle.
- build in collision for particals.
- add gravity
- include a different mechanism for removing balls from bottle (perhaps falling)
